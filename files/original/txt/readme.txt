1.3 MULTIPLAYER SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

• For 16 player multiplayer the Recommended System 
Requirements are strongly suggested
• Internet (TCP/IP) and LAN (TCP/IP) play supported. 
• Internet play requires broadband connection, latest drivers.
• LAN play requires network interface card, latest drivers. 


1.4  STEAM CLIENT INSTALLATION AND ACCOUNT CREATION

The Space Marine installer will check your computer for an existing 
installation of the Steam Client. If it detects that no Steam Client is 
installed, it will automatically begin an installation of the Client. If it 
detects an older version of the Steam Client the installer will update that 
version to the most current.

Following the Steam Client installation and/or update, the installer will 
prompt you for your Steam Account login information. If you do not already 
have a Steam Account, you will create an account at this time.


1.5  DIRECTX(R) DETECTION AND INSTALLATION

The Space Marine installer will check your computer for the currently 
installed version of DirectX(R). If it detects an older version of DirectX(R), it 
will install DirectX(R) 9.0c and 10 automatically. The installation of DirectX(R) 
will not harm your DirectX(R) configuration. Space Marine requires
DirectX(R) to install and play.



=====================================================================
2) TROUBLESHOOTING
=====================================================================

2.1 CRASH REPORTING

Space Marine utilizes a crash reporting tool called Bugsplat. In the event
of a crash, the user is given the option to upload crash information to our
Bugsplat's service. The report provides the development team important
information about the nature of the crash and allows them to explore
resolutions to the problem. No personal or identifiable information is
transmitted in a Bugsplat crash report.


2.2 INSTALLER/PATCH ISSUES

A. Interference from Anti-Virus Programs 
It is recommended that any anti-virus programs be disabled when attempting to 
install Space Marine. Anti-virus software can often interfere and corrupt 
the installation process of new software.

B. Modifications 
Any modifications to Space Marine may result in the inability to patch 
successfully.  Before applying any modifications we suggest backing up the 
affected files and replacing them before applying any patch.  Not doing so may 
result in the need to re-install the game.


2.3 VIDEO ISSUES

A. Latest drivers required 
For best performance and video quality, please make sure you have the latest 
drivers for your video card when running Space Marine. If you have an ATI or 
NVIDIA video card, you can find drivers on their websites.

        http://ati.amd.com/ 
        Driver: Catalyst 11.7 or newer
        
        http://www.nvidia.com/ 
        Driver: ForceWare Graphics Driver Version 280.26 or newer

Preliminary tests with out-of-date ATI drivers have shown some graphic 
corruption while playing Space Marine. Upgrading to the latest ATI drivers 
can solve the problem for most users.

Preliminary tests with out-of-date NVIDIA drivers have shown lower performance 
and missing objects. Upgrading to the latest NVIDIA drivers can solve the 
problem for most users.

B. Exceeding recommended Auto Settings for Graphics Options 
Exceeding the recommended Auto Settings for Graphics Options can result in 
undesired performance degradation and graphical errors because the settings 
are exceeding the capabilities of your hardware. If you are experiencing 
graphical issues after installing the latest graphics card drivers, ensure 
Auto Settings is selected in the Graphics Options page of the game's Main 
Menu.

2.4 SOUND ISSUES

A. Latest drivers required 
Please make sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card when running 
Space Marine.

B. The sound stutters while playing 
Make sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card. If stuttering 
persists try reducing Hardware Acceleration. From your Windows(R) desktop, 
click Start, then Run, type "dxdiag", then hit Enter. This brings up the 
"DirectX(R) Diagnostic Tool". Click the Sound tab and try reducing the 
"Hardware Sound Acceleration Level" slider.


2.5 OPERATING SYSTEM-SPECIFIC ISSUES
A.  Windows(R) Key Interrupts Game 
If the Windows(R) key is pressed during game play, the Start Menu will 
interrupt the game. Should this happen, simply press the Escape (Esc) key to 
close the menu and return to the game. Unfortunately, there is no way to 
prevent this from happening again except by being careful not to hit those 
keys while playing.

B.  Administrator Privileges Needed To Install On Windows(R) XP, Vista(R) and Windows 7(R). 
You must have Administrator privileges to properly install the game. You do 
not, however, require Administrator privileges to play the game after it has 
been installed.
For information on how to change your user settings to obtain Administrator 
privileges, please refer to your Windows(R) documentation, or click the Start 
button and select  'Help and Support'.

C.  Alt-Tab to Switch Applications 
Some drivers do not support the Alt-Tab switching between Space Marine
 and other applications. It is highly recommended that you do not use Alt-Tab to 
switch to another program while Space Marine is running. If you wish to 
switch programs, first close Space Marine. Using Alt-Tab while Space Marine 
is loading can result in loss of all sound when returning to the game.


2.6  MULTIPLAYER & INTERNET ISSUES

A.  Firewall Issues 
- If you have a firewall it may be blocking Space Marine but the firewall 
popup window is not showing in front of the game. Quit the game or bring up 
the task manager and end the Space Marine task. Go to your firewall settings 
and correctly configure them for Space Marine. 
- If you have a firewall such as ZoneAlarm or Norton Personal Firewall, then 
you need to make sure that you have given Space Marine permission to access 
the internet and to accept connections from the internet.
- If you have the Windows(R) Firewall enabled, you need to make sure that Space Marine
 is listed and selected in the "Exceptions" section of the firewall 
options. To do this open the 'Control Panel', double-click the Network 
Connections icon, and right-click on your internet connection. Select 
'Properties', then 'Advanced'. You should now see the 'Settings' button for 
the Windows Firewall. Click the button and make sure that the firewall is 
turned off, or that 'spacemarine.exe' is selected in the 'Exceptions' tab of the 
Windows(R) Firewall dialog box.
- If problems persist try disabling the firewall.

B. NOD32 Virus Checker users 
- NOD32 scans the network activity of the programs on your machine. You need 
to configure NOD32 to exclude Space Marine from scans as it will drastically 
degrade online performance. In the IMON setup, under the Miscellaneous tab, 
press the edit button within the Exclusion box/zone. Press the Add button in 
the Exclude Application dialog and find the spacemarine.exe on your hard drive to add 
it to the exclusion list.


2.7  KNOWN ISSUES
 
A. When running in Windowed mode, the game fails to recover if it loses focus 
Space Marine does not support running in a "windowed" mode. Remove any 
command lines forcing windowed mode from your game shortcut.

B. NVIDIA 400-series cards running with Windows XP can potentially crash when 
using ALT+TAB to change focus from the game. This will be resolved in a future
(newer than 280.26) release of the NVIDIA Display Driver.


=====================================================================
3. IMPROVING PERFORMANCE 
=====================================================================

There are several ways to improve the performance of Space Marine on min and 
mid-spec systems, all accessible through the Options menu:

Choosing the Automatic Settings in the options menu will adjust the settings 
to best fit your hardware. If that does not work try some of the following:

- Reduce the resolution         - Select a lower resolution from the drop-down menu.
- Reduce the Shadows Detail	- Select a lower shadow detail.
- Reduce the Visual FX Detail	- Select a lower VisualFX Detail.
- Disable Post Processing	- Turn Post Processing to off.
- Disable Virtical Sync		- Turn Vertical Sync to off.
- Disable Ambient occlusion	- Turn ambient occlusion off

SEGA reserves the right to amend this Agreement at any time, at its sole discretion.  

If any part of the Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.  Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of the Agreement or related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.

SEGA may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.  Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under the Agreement without SEGA’s express prior written consent.
SEGA’s performance of the Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Agreement is in derogation of SEGA’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Game Software or information provided to or gathered by SEGA with respect to such use.

Nothing in this Agreement gives or claims to give to any third party any benefit or right to enforce any term of this Agreement, and the provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (as amended or modified from  time to time) are expressly excluded.

The parties agree that all correspondence relating to this Agreement shall be written in the English language.
