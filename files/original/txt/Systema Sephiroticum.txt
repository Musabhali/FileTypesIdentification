Diagrams of creation as concieved within the ancient Judaic mystical traddition known as 
Kabbalah. Historically, many non-Jews have attempted to adapt, or co-opt, such to their 
own systems of belief or practise. This has often taken on an anti-semeitc expression.

Supersessionism is when believers in newer religions based on Judaism 
(Christianity 27AD, Islam 610AD, both of which regard the God with whom the 
Jewish patriarch Abraham made a covenant in 1850BC as also being their god.) express the 
idea that their new religion "supersedes" an original Judaism that is now irrelevant.

Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher (1602 - 1680) drew a digrammatic interpretation of the
Kabbalah and gave it the Latin name "Systema Sephiroticum" (sytem of the sephira).

The pattern describes fundamental Jewish Kabbalistic beliefs: that the ten "sephirah" 
(ciphers) in the digrams, are attributes of god, linked together by a complex pattern that 
serves also as a model, map, schematic and code for the totality of creation; thereby, 
through its study, all knowledge of creation and god can eventually be revealed and 
understood by human beings.

For this to happen in Kaballah, is in the fact the purpose of existence itself, as Kabbalists
believe that creation - where one made many - "occurred because god wished to behold god," 
and therefore, "Face must behold Face." Only when our knowledge of creation - including its 
experiences and possibilities as brought about by free will - is complete, will all 
existence be reunited with god.
